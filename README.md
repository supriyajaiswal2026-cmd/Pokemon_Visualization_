Pokemon Stats Analysis | Tableau Story

I’m excited to share my latest data visualization project where I analyzed a comprehensive dataset of Pokemon statistics to uncover trends in power creep, combat attributes, and global trainer distribution.

🔍 Tools Used: • Tableau (Dashboards & Story Points) • Data Cleaning & Analysis • Excel/CSV Data

📊 Key Insights: • Power Creep is Real: Analysis confirms a clear upward trend in base stats across later generations. • Archetype Identification: Visualized the gap between "Glass Cannons" (High Attack/Low Defense) and "Tank" builds. • Type Dominance: Fire and Dragon types show consistently higher attack stats compared to others. • Geographic Distribution: Mapped trainer locations to visualize where the strongest teams originate globally.
